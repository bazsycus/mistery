       <h2>Hey Megumi =3<br>
      </h2>
        <p>  I congratulate you for successfully solving <br>
            my riddle. I don't think it was that hard.   <br>
            I am....well, you know who I am :))   <br>
            No need to intoduce myself...<br>
            <br>
            So you are probably asking, why am I being   <br>
            so mysterious...well, to be honest, I just<br>
            wanted to do something fun and exciting,<br>
            after all it's Christmas time. If I'm not<br>
            mistaken, by the time you read this you <br>
            are already in Kyushu, visiting Kako :))<br>
            I hope you are having a chill holiday. <br>
                                                       <br>
            I know; lately we barely even texted each other.<br>
            But despite all that, I think about you a lot,<br>
            every day, to be precise,and I miss you.<br>
            Maybe I became alienated to you,and I completely <br>
            understand it, tho I would really love to talk... <br>
            You know...just like the good old times :P<br>
       </p> 
        <a> The reason I'm writing you,first of all, is to<br>
            wish you Merry Christmas, and most importantly <br>
            to give you my best regards for the next year.   <br>
            I hope 2021 will be our year, when we fianlly meet.<br>
            Let's hope for the best! Also, I sent you a package. <br>
            When you'll arrive back to Tokyo it should already<br>
            be there, but maybe because of the holiday season it <br> 
            will get there with a bit of delay. Well..no problemo<br>
            I apologise in advance tho :)) Cuz the package turned<be>
            out a little bigger then I expected..so make sure you<be>
            take breaks when carrying it back home :)))
            Still, I think it's worth the effort. You will like it!<br>
